# flutter_wallet_card

Flutter plugin which allows users to create their own Apple Wallet Passes (as well as Google Cards).

## Getting Started

### Getting pass from URL and displays it on device.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_wallet_card/flutter_wallet_card.dart';

bool isCardShown = await FlutterWalletCard.createPassFromUri(
  scheme: 'https',
  host: 'example.com',
  path: '/wallet.pkpass',
  parameters: {
    'someQueryParameter': 'someQueryValue'
  }
);
```

## Contribute

Please feel free to fork, improve, make pull requests or fill issues.
I'll be glad to fix bugs you encountered or improve the extension.

## Roadmap

At this moment some of key features are not working as intended to:
- [ ] MercuryWork on Android Devices
- [ ] Listen to onCardAdd iOS handler in order to check if card was added or not
